# Supabase Database Setup for Election Candidates

This directory contains SQL scripts to set up the database for the Election Candidates application in Supabase.

## üìÅ Files

- **`simple_setup.sql`** - Basic setup with essential features (recommended for quick start)
- **`supabase_setup.sql`** - Complete setup with advanced features (recommended for production)

## üöÄ Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for the project to be ready

### Step 2: Run the SQL Script
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `simple_setup.sql`
4. Paste and run the script

### Step 3: Verify Setup
Run these queries in the SQL Editor to verify everything works:

```sql
-- Check if table was created
SELECT * FROM candidates ORDER BY id;

-- Check party statistics
SELECT * FROM party_statistics;

-- Check table structure
\d candidates;
```

## üèóÔ∏è Complete Setup (Advanced)

If you want all the advanced features, use `supabase_setup.sql` instead. This includes:

- ‚úÖ Automatic `updated_at` timestamp triggers
- ‚úÖ Advanced RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Fake candidate generation function
- ‚úÖ Statistics function
- ‚úÖ Performance optimizations
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive permissions

## üìä Database Schema

### Candidates Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE candidates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    image_url VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    party party_type NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Party Type Enum
```sql
CREATE TYPE party_type AS ENUM ('PSD', 'PNL', 'POT', 'AUR', 'Independent');
```

### Party Statistics View
```sql
CREATE VIEW party_statistics AS
SELECT 
    party,
    COUNT(*) as candidate_count,
    ROUND((COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM candidates)), 2) as percentage
FROM candidates
GROUP BY party
ORDER BY candidate_count DESC;
```

## üîê Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Public Read Access**: Anyone can view candidates
- **Authenticated Write Access**: Only authenticated users can create/update/delete

### RLS Policies
```sql
-- Public read access
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON candidates FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Authenticated users can insert
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated insert" ON candidates FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Authenticated users can update
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated update" ON candidates FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Authenticated users can delete
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated delete" ON candidates FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Indexes
- `idx_candidates_party` - Fast party filtering and statistics
- `idx_candidates_name` - Fast name search
- `idx_candidates_created_at` - Fast date sorting

## üéØ API Integration

Once the database is set up, you can integrate it with your backend by:

1. **Install Supabase Client**:
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

3. **Update Backend** to use Supabase instead of in-memory storage

## üîç Useful Queries

### Get All Candidates
```sql
SELECT * FROM candidates ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Get Candidates by Party
```sql
SELECT * FROM candidates WHERE party = 'PSD';
```

### Get Party Statistics
```sql
SELECT * FROM party_statistics;
```

### Search Candidates by Name
```sql
SELECT * FROM candidates WHERE name ILIKE '%Alexandru%';
```

### Get Recent Candidates
```sql
SELECT * FROM candidates ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   - Make sure RLS policies are correctly set up
   - Check if you're authenticated for write operations

2. **Enum Type Error**
   - Ensure the `party_type` enum is created before the table
   - Check that party values match the enum exactly

3. **Sequence Error**
   - Make sure the `candidates_id_seq` sequence exists
   - Grant proper permissions to authenticated users

### Reset Database
If you need to start over:

```sql
-- Drop everything (be careful!)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS candidates CASCADE;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS party_type CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS party_statistics CASCADE;

-- Then run the setup script again
```

## üìù Notes

- The database uses **PostgreSQL** (Supabase's default)
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** is enabled for security
- **Timestamps** are automatically managed
- **Party values** are restricted to the enum type
- **Initial data** includes 8 sample candidates

## üéâ Next Steps

After setting up the database:

1. Update your backend to use Supabase client
2. Test the API endpoints
3. Update frontend to handle authentication if needed
4. Deploy your application

The database is now ready for your Election Candidates application! üöÄ 

# Database Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Supabase project set up
- Database connection established

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Users Table
First, run the users table setup script:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of users_setup.sql
```

### 2. Create Candidates Table
Run the candidates table setup script:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of supabase_setup.sql
```

### 3. Create Votes Table
Run the votes table setup script:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of votes_setup_simple.sql
```

## How to Execute SQL Scripts

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of each SQL file
4. Click "Run" to execute

### Option 2: Supabase CLI
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Run the SQL scripts
supabase db push
```

### Option 3: Direct Database Connection
If you have direct access to your PostgreSQL database:
```bash
psql -h YOUR_HOST -U YOUR_USER -d YOUR_DATABASE -f votes_setup_simple.sql
```

## Verification

After running the scripts, you should have:
- ‚úÖ `users` table with CNP field
- ‚úÖ `candidates` table with party enum
- ‚úÖ `votes` table with user and candidate references
- ‚úÖ `vote_statistics` view for vote analytics
- ‚úÖ Proper indexes for performance

## Troubleshooting

### "relation does not exist" errors
- Make sure you've run all the SQL scripts in order
- Check that you're connected to the correct database
- Verify that the tables were created successfully

### Permission errors
- Ensure your database user has the necessary privileges
- Check that the GRANT statements in the scripts executed successfully

### Foreign key constraint errors
- Make sure the `users` and `candidates` tables exist before creating the `votes` table
- Verify that the referenced columns have the correct data types

## Testing the Setup

You can test if everything is working by running these queries:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name IN ('users', 'candidates', 'votes');

-- Check if view exists
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'vote_statistics';

-- Test inserting a vote (replace with actual user_id and candidate_id)
INSERT INTO votes (user_id, candidate_id) VALUES (1, 1);
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure your backend has the correct environment variables set in `.env`:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```
